      <h2>My Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The world of front-end development has always fascinated me. The ability to create visually stunning, user-friendly interfaces that people interact with daily is both an art and a science. For me, front-end development is more than just writing code—it’s about solving problems, enhancing user experiences, and bringing ideas to life.
